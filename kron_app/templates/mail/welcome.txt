Dear {{user.first_name}},

Welcome to Kronistic! {{status()}}

Here are some important things to know about how Kronistic works:

Your available times
- You can update the times you are available for meetings at My Availability [{{availability_url}}].
- As requested, your initial meeting availability is {{fmt_available_time(**user.setup_data)}}.
- The system checks your synced calendars to see when you are busy. You can sync additional calendars on your Profile [{{profile_url}}].

Your Kronistic meetings
- When you are added to a meeting, Kronistic will add a DRAFT event on your Google calendar.
- DRAFT meetings can (and will!) move.
- When you add events to your synced calendar(s) that conflict with a DRAFT meeting, Kronistic automatically reschedules the DRAFT.
- Once a meeting time is finalized, you will get an email (you can adjust the frequency of notifications in your Profile [{{profile_url}}]).
- To schedule a meeting, go to the New Meeting page [{{new_meeting_url}}].
- Track and update your Kronistic meetings on the My Meetings page [{{meetings_url}}].

We look forward to supporting your busy schedule!

Sincerely,
Team Kronistic
